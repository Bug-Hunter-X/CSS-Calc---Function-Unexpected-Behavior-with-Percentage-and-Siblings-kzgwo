The following CSS code snippet demonstrates a potential issue with unexpected behavior when using the `calc()` function with percentage values and sibling selectors.

```css
.container {
  width: 50%;
}

.sibling {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
}
```

The issue arises when the sibling element's width is calculated based on the parent's width (which is 50% of the viewport).  The `calc()` function correctly subtracts 10px, but the result might be unexpected if the container element itself isn't taking up the full width of its parent.
