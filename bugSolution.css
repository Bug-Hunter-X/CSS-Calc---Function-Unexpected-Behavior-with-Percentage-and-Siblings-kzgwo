The solution involves making the parent's width explicit or using viewport units (`vw`) for more consistent results.  Here's an example:

```css
.container {
  width: 50%; /* or width: 50vw; for viewport-relative width */
  box-sizing: border-box; /* If you have padding or border on the container */
}

.parent {
  width: 100%; /* Ensure parent takes full available width */
}

.sibling {
  width: calc(50% - 10px); /* Calculation is now relative to the parent's full width */
}
```

By ensuring the parent element occupies the full width, the calculation becomes more predictable. Alternatively, using `vw` units ensures the percentage is always relative to the viewport and not subject to the variability of parent widths.
